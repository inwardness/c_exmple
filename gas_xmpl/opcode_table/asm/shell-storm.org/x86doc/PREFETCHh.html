<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Fetches the line of data from memory that contains the byte specified with the source operand to a location in the cache hierarchy specified by a locality hint:</p>
<p>The source operand is a byte memory location. (The locality hints are encoded into the machine level instruction using bits 3 through 5 of the ModR/M byte.)</p>
<p>If the line selected is already present in the cache hierarchy at a level closer to the processor, no data movement occurs. Prefetches from uncacheable or WC memory are ignored.</p>
<p>The PREFETCH<em>h</em> instruction is merely a hint and does not affect program behavior. If executed, this instruction moves data closer to the processor in anticipation of future use.</p>
<p>The implementation of prefetch locality hints is implementation-dependent, and can be overloaded or ignored by a processor implementation. The amount of data prefetched is also processor implementation-dependent. It will, however, be a minimum of 32 bytes. Additional details of the implementation-dependent locality hints are described in Section 7.4 of <em>Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Optimization Reference Manual</em>.</p>
<p>It should be noted that processors are free to speculatively fetch and cache data from system memory regions that are assigned a memory-type that permits speculative reads (that is, the WB, WC, and WT memory types). A PREFETCH<em>h</em> instruction is considered a hint to this speculative behavior. Because this speculative fetching can occur at any time and is not tied to instruction execution, a PREFETCH<em>h</em> instruction is not ordered with respect to the fence instructions (MFENCE, SFENCE, and LFENCE) or locked memory references. A PREFETCH<em>h</em> instruction is also unordered with respect to CLFLUSH and CLFLUSHOPT instructions, other PREFETCH<em>h </em>instructions, or any other general instruction. It is ordered with respect to serializing instructions such as CPUID, WRMSR, OUT, and MOV CR.</p>
<p>This instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode.</p>
<h2>Operation</h2>
<pre>
FETCH (m8);
</pre>
<h2>Intel C/C++ Compiler Intrinsic Equivalent</h2>
<pre>
void _mm_prefetch(char *p, int i)
The argument “*p” gives the address of the byte (and corresponding cache line) to be prefetched. The value “i” gives a constant (_MM_HINT_T0, _MM_HINT_T1, _MM_HINT_T2, or _MM_HINT_NTA) that specifies the type of prefetch operation to be performed.
