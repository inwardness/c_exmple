<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The ID flag (bit 21) in the EFLAGS register indicates support for the CPUID instruction. If a software procedure can set and clear this flag, the processor executing the procedure supports the CPUID instruction. This instruction operates the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode.</p>
<p>CPUID returns processor identification and feature information in the EAX, EBX, ECX, and EDX registers.<sup>1</sup> The instruction’s output is dependent on the contents of the EAX register upon execution (in some cases, ECX as well). For example, the following pseudocode loads EAX with 00H and causes CPUID to return a Maximum Return Value and the Vendor Identification String in the appropriate registers:</p>
<p>MOV EAX, 00H</p>
<p>CPUID</p>
<p><a href="CMPSS.html#tbl-3-8">Table 3-8</a> shows information returned, depending on the initial value loaded into the EAX register.</p>
<p>Two types of information are returned: basic and extended function information. If a value entered for CPUID.EAX is higher than the maximum input value for basic or extended function for that processor then the data for the highest basic information leaf is returned. For example, using some Intel processors, the following is true:</p>
<p>CPUID.EAX = 05H (* Returns MONITOR/MWAIT leaf. *)</p>
<p>CPUID.EAX = 0AH (* Returns Architectural Performance Monitoring leaf. *) CPUID.EAX = 0BH (* Returns Extended Topology Enumeration leaf. *)<sup>2</sup> CPUID.EAX =1FH (* Returns V2 Extended Topology Enumeration leaf. *)<sup>2</sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. On Intel 64 processors, CPUID clears the high 32 bits of the RAX/RBX/RCX/RDX registers in all modes.</p>
<p>2. CPUID leaf 1FH is a preferred superset to leaf 0BH. Intel recommends first checking for the existence of CPUID leaf 1FH before using leaf 0BH.</p></blockquote>
<p>CPUID.EAX = 80000008H (* Returns linear/physical address size data. *)</p>
<p>CPUID.EAX = 8000000AH (* INVALID: Returns same information as CPUID.EAX = 0BH. *)</p>
<p>If a value entered for CPUID.EAX is less than or equal to the maximum input value and the leaf is not supported on that processor then 0 is returned in all the registers.</p>
<p>When CPUID returns the highest basic leaf information as a result of an invalid input EAX value, any dependence on input ECX value in the basic leaf is honored.</p>
<p>CPUID can be executed at any privilege level to serialize instruction execution. Serializing instruction execution guarantees that any modifications to flags, registers, and memory for previous instructions are completed before the next instruction is fetched and executed.</p>

<p>A vendor identification string is also returned in EBX, EDX, and ECX. For Intel processors, the string is “GenuineIntel” and is expressed:</p>
<p>EBX ← 756e6547h (* “Genu”, with G in the low eight bits of BL *) EDX ← 49656e69h (* “ineI”, with i in the low eight bits of DL *) ECX ← 6c65746eh (* “ntel”, with n in the low eight bits of CL *)</p>
<h2>INPUT EAX = 80000000H: Returns CPUID’s Highest Value for Extended Processor Information</h2>
<p>When CPUID executes with EAX set to 80000000H, the processor returns the highest value the processor recognizes for returning extended processor information. The value is returned in the EAX register and is processor specific.</p>
<h2>IA32_BIOS_SIGN_ID Returns Microcode Update Signature</h2>
<p>For processors that support the microcode update facility, the IA32_BIOS_SIGN_ID MSR is loaded with the update signature whenever CPUID executes. The signature is returned in the upper DWORD. For details, see Chapter 9 in the <em>Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3A</em>.</p>
<h2>INPUT EAX = 01H: Returns Model, Family, Stepping Information</h2>
<p>When CPUID executes with EAX set to 01H, version information is returned. For example: model, family, and processor type for the Intel Xeon processor 5100 series is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Model — 1111B</li>
<li>Family — 0101B</li>
<li>Processor Type — 00B</li></ul>
<p>See <a href="CMPSS.html#tbl-3-9">Table 3-9</a> for available processor type values. Stepping IDs are provided as needed.</p>

<h2>INPUT EAX = 02H: TLB/Cache/Prefetch Information Returned in EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX</h2>
<p>When CPUID executes with EAX set to 02H, the processor returns information about the processor’s internal TLBs, cache and prefetch hardware in the EAX, EBX, ECX, and EDX registers. The information is reported in encoded form and fall into the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>The least-significant byte in register EAX (register AL) will always return 01H. Software should ignore this value and not interpret it as an informational descriptor.</li>
<li>The most significant bit (bit 31) of each register indicates whether the register contains valid information (set to 0) or is reserved (set to 1).</li>
<li>If a register contains valid information, the information is contained in 1 byte descriptors. There are four types of encoding values for the byte descriptor, the encoding type is noted in the second column of <a href="CPUID.html#tbl-3-12">Table 3-12</a>. Table 3-12 lists the encoding of these descriptors. Note that the order of descriptors in the EAX, EBX, ECX, and EDX registers is not defined; that is, specific bytes are not designated to contain descriptors for specific cache, prefetch, or TLB types. The descriptors may appear in any order. Note also a processor may report a general descriptor type (FFH) and not report any byte descriptor of “cache type” via CPUID leaf 2.</li></ul>

<h2>Example 3-1. Example of Cache and TLB Interpretation</h2>
<p>The first member of the family of Pentium 4 processors returns the following information about caches and TLBs when the CPUID executes with an input value of 2:</p>
<p>EAX 66 5B 50 01H EBX 0H ECX 0H EDX 00 7A 70 00H</p>
<p>Which means:</p>
<ul>
<li>The least-significant byte (byte 0) of register EAX is set to 01H. This value should be ignored.</li>
<li>The most-significant bit of all four registers (EAX, EBX, ECX, and EDX) is set to 0, indicating that each register contains valid 1-byte descriptors.</li>
<li>Bytes 1, 2, and 3 of register EAX indicate that the processor has:

<h2>INPUT EAX = 04H: Returns Deterministic Cache Parameters for Each Level</h2>
<p>When CPUID executes with EAX set to 04H and ECX contains an index value, the processor returns encoded data that describe a set of deterministic cache parameters (for the cache level associated with the input in ECX). Valid index values start from 0.</p>
<p>Software can enumerate the deterministic cache parameters for each level of the cache hierarchy starting with an index value of 0, until the parameters report the value associated with the cache type field is 0. The architecturally defined fields reported by deterministic cache parameters are documented in <a href="CMPSS.html#tbl-3-8">Table 3-8</a>.</p>
<p>This Cache Size in Bytes</p>
<p>= (Ways + 1) * (Partitions + 1) * (Line_Size + 1) * (Sets + 1)</p>
<p>= (EBX[31:22] + 1) * (EBX[21:12] + 1) * (EBX[11:0] + 1) * (ECX + 1)</p>
<p>The CPUID leaf 04H also reports data that can be used to derive the topology of processor cores in a physical package. This information is constant for all valid index values. Software can query the raw data reported by executing CPUID with EAX=04H and ECX=0 and use it as part of the topology enumeration algorithm described in Chapter 8, “Multiple-Processor Management,” in the <em>Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3A</em>.</p>
<h2>INPUT EAX = 05H: Returns MONITOR and MWAIT Features</h2>
<p>When CPUID executes with EAX set to 05H, the processor returns information about features available to MONITOR/MWAIT instructions.

In subleaf 0, EAX returns the maximum input value of the highest leaf 7 sub-leaf, and EBX, ECX &amp; EDX contain information of extended feature flags.</p>
<h2>INPUT EAX = 09H: Returns Direct Cache Access Information</h2>
<p>When CPUID executes with EAX set to 09H, the processor returns information about Direct Cache Access capabilities. See <a href="CMPSS.html#tbl-3-8">Table 3-8</a>.</p>

Architectural performance monitoring is supported if the version ID (see Table 3-8) is greater than Pn 0. See <a href="CMPSS.html#tbl-3-8">Table 3-8</a>.</p>
<p>For each version of architectural performance monitoring capability, software must enumerate this leaf to discover the programming facilities and the architectural performance events available in the processor. The details are described in Chapter 23, “Introduction to Virtual-Machine Extensions,” in the <em>Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3C</em>.</p>

See <a href="CMPSS.html#tbl-3-8">Table 3-8</a>. Software can use the forward-extendable technique depicted below to query the valid sub-leaves and obtain size and offset information for each processor extended state save area:</p>
<p>For i = 2 to 62 // sub-leaf 1 is reserved IF (CPUID.(EAX=0DH, ECX=0):VECTOR[i] = 1 ) // VECTOR is the 64-bit value of EDX:EAX Execute CPUID.(EAX=0DH, ECX = i) to examine size and offset for sub-leaf i; FI;</p>

<p>When CPUID executes with EAX set to 0FH and ECX = 0, the processor returns information about the bit-vector representation of QoS monitoring resource types that are supported in the processor and maximum range of RMID values the processor can use to monitor of any supported resource types. Each bit, starting from bit 1, corresponds to a specific resource type if the bit is set. The bit position corresponds to the sub-leaf index (or ResID) that software must use to query QoS monitoring capability available for that type. See <a href="CMPSS.html#tbl-3-8">Table 3-8</a>.</p>
<p>When CPUID executes with EAX set to 0FH and ECX = n (n &gt;= 1, and is a valid ResID), the processor returns information software can use to program IA32_PQR_ASSOC, IA32_QM_EVTSEL MSRs before reading QoS data from the IA32_QM_CTR MSR.</p>

<h2>INPUT EAX = 14H: Returns Intel Processor Trace Enumeration Information</h2>
<p>When CPUID executes with EAX set to 14H and ECX = 0H, the processor returns information about Intel Processor Trace extensions. See <a href="CMPSS.html#tbl-3-8">Table 3-8</a>.</p>

See <a href="CMPSS.html#tbl-3-8">Table 3-8</a>.</p>
<h2>METHODS FOR RETURNING BRANDING INFORMATION</h2>
<p>Use the following techniques to access branding information:</p>
<p>1. Processor brand string method.</p>
<p>2. Processor brand index; this method uses a software supplied brand string table.</p>
<p>These two methods are discussed in the following sections. For methods that are available in early processors, see Section: “Identification of Earlier IA-32 Processors” in Chapter 19 of the <em>Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1</em>.</p>
<h2>The Processor Brand String Method</h2>
<p>Processor brand identification software should execute this algorithm on all Intel 64 and IA-32 processors.</p>
<p>This method (introduced with Pentium 4 processors) returns an ASCII brand identification string and the Processor Base frequency of the processor to the EAX, EBX, ECX, and EDX registers.</p>
<h2>How Brand Strings Work</h2>
<p>To use the brand string method, execute CPUID with EAX input of 8000002H through 80000004H. For each input value, CPUID returns 16 ASCII characters using EAX, EBX, ECX, and EDX. The returned string will be NULL-terminated.</p>
<p><a href="CPUID.html#tbl-3-13">Table 3-13</a> shows the brand string that is returned by the first processor in the Pentium 4 processor family.</p>

<h2>Extracting the Processor Frequency from Brand Strings</h2>
<h2>The Processor Brand Index Method</h2>
<p>The brand index method (introduced with Pentium<sup>®</sup> III Xeon<sup>®</sup> processors) provides an entry point into a brand identification table that is maintained in memory by system software and is accessible from system- and user-level code. In this table, each brand index is associate with an ASCII brand identification string that identifies the official Intel family and model number of a processor.</p>
<p>When CPUID executes with EAX set to 1, the processor returns a brand index to the low byte in EBX. Software can then use this index to locate the brand identification string for the processor in the brand identification table. The first entry (brand index 0) in this table is reserved, allowing for backward compatibility with processors that do not support the brand identification feature. Starting with processor signature family ID = 0FH, model = 03H, brand index method is no longer supported. Use brand string method instead.</p>
